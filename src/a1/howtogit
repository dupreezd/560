update you code w/ master every time you start working:

    git pull        (pull frequently to avoid merge conflicts!)

to add your changes:

    git add .
    git commit -m "insert brief message explaining what you changed"
    git push

bonus:

    git status      ...will show you what changes you made but haven't added
    git add -p      ...will let you pick which of your changes to push and which to ignore
